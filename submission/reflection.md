# ✍️ Project Reflection

AI Tools Used
For this project, I primarily used ChatGPT as my AI assistant. It helped me in several ways: generating initial drafts of code, debugging errors, explaining why certain functions failed, and suggesting improvements to code structure. I also used AI to brainstorm test cases and to refine my natural language processing logic. Rather than simply copying outputs, I treated the AI as a collaborator, reviewing and modifying the code to fit my specific project requirements.

Prompting Techniques
I applied intentional prompting techniques throughout development. For example, I broke down complex tasks into smaller steps (“Write just the setup and imports section first”), asked for code in specific formats (“Give me a complete function I can copy directly”), and clarified constraints (“Do not include Chinese in the code comments”). I also used iterative prompting—testing the output, identifying issues, and then prompting again with more detail to refine the solution. This step-by-step approach helped me stay in control of the development process.

What Worked Well?
I am most proud of how the Weather Data Functions and Visualisation Functions turned out. Retrieving structured weather data and converting it into intuitive temperature and precipitation charts gave the project real value. These functions demonstrated modular design and practical data handling skills. I also liked how the NLP component allowed users to ask natural questions such as “Will it rain tomorrow?” and receive meaningful answers. It felt like creating a real interactive assistant rather than just a static program.

What Would You Do Differently?
If I had more time, I would add extensions such as historical weather analysis or location-based recommendations (e.g., “Is tomorrow good for hiking?”). I would also implement more robust error handling and input validation to make the system more resilient to unexpected queries or API failures. In addition, I would like to experiment with different visualisation styles to make the charts more engaging and informative.

Final Thoughts
This project taught me how to integrate different areas of programming—API calls, data processing, visualisation, and natural language interaction—into one cohesive application. More importantly, I learned how to work effectively with AI tools: not as a replacement for my own problem-solving, but as a supportive partner that speeds up development and provides new perspectives. Overall, the experience gave me both technical confidence and a better understanding of how to use AI responsibly in software development.
