WeatherWise 🌤️
Project Overview

WeatherWise is a Python-based weather application built in Google Colab.
The project was designed as part of a learning exercise to practice modular programming, data visualisation, natural language processing, and user interface design.

With WeatherWise, users can:

🌡️ Check current weather (temperature, humidity, wind, precipitation, condition).

📅 View a 5-day forecast (min/max temperature, conditions, chance of rain).

📊 Visualise trends using two different charts:

Line chart of daily min/max temperatures.

Bar chart of daily precipitation chances.

💬 Ask natural language questions, e.g. “Will it rain tomorrow?” or “How humid is it today?”.

🖥️ Navigate via a menu system (powered by pyinputplus if available, with a fallback to simple input).

Features

Weather Data Retrieval from the free wttr.in
 API.

Structured Output: separates current and forecast weather data.

Error Handling for invalid inputs or API failures.

Data Visualisations: temperature line chart and precipitation bar chart.

NLP Parsing: extracts topics (temperature, rain, wind, humidity) and days (today, tomorrow, weekdays).

User Interface: clean console menu, supports multiple interactions.

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites

A Google account (to use Google Colab).

Web browser with internet access.

Step 1: Open in Google Colab

Download or clone the repository.

Open Google Colab
.

Upload WeatherWise_MyProject.ipynb.

Step 2: Install Required Libraries

The first cell in the notebook handles dependencies.
If needed, run manually:

!pip install pyinputplus

Step 3: Run the Notebook

Run cells in order (Setup → Functions → Main → Testing).

When prompted, enter a city (e.g., Perth).

Use the menu to explore current weather, forecast, visualisations, or natural language queries.

Troubleshooting

Invalid City: If input is invalid, the app will show an error and re-prompt.

Network Issues: Ensure Colab has internet access.

Missing pyinputplus: Install with !pip install pyinputplus.

ChatGPT was used as an AI assistant to help generate, refine, and debug code, as well as to design testing strategies.

Weather data provided by the free wttr.in API.
