Conversation 5 â€” Improving User Experience & Menu Design

Header: Conversation about designing the user interface (menu and error handling) for WeatherWise.
Goal: Implement a user-friendly menu system with robust input handling and clear error messages.
Intentional prompting techniques used: Request iterative improvements, query design trade-offs, ask for alternatives.

Me: I need a user interface for my weather app. The rubric suggests using a menu. What should it include?

AI: A good menu could include:
1. Current Weather
2. 5-Day Forecast
3. Temperature Chart
4. Precipitation Chart
5. Ask a Question (NLP)
6. Exit

This covers all core features and makes navigation intuitive.

Me: How should I implement it?

AI: Option 1: Use pyinputplus.inputMenu to display a numbered menu and validate the choice automatically.  
Option 2: Use plain input() with try/except for validation.  
Both are acceptable; pyinputplus is cleaner, but input() is more portable if external libraries are restricted.

Me: What would error handling look like with input()?

AI: Example:
choice = input("Enter your choice (1â€“6): ")
if choice not in ["1","2","3","4","5","6"]:
    print("Invalid choice, please try again.")

This ensures the program does not crash and guides the user.

Me: Which approach do you recommend for my assignment?

AI: Use pyinputplus if allowedâ€”it reduces boilerplate and shows familiarity with external libraries. But also implement a fallback input() version in case pyinputplus isnâ€™t available. Document the trade-off in your reflection: simplicity vs portability.

Me: How can I improve user experience beyond just error handling?

AI:
- Add clear section headers (e.g., "=== Current Weather ===")
- Use emojis for readability (ðŸŒ¤, ðŸŒ§, ðŸ’¨)
- Provide consistent formatting for outputs
- Add short explanations when data is missing or uncertain
- Allow returning to the menu without restarting the program

Me: Summarise the iterative improvements we discussed.

AI:
1. Start with a simple numbered menu
2. Add validation (pyinputplus or input + try/except)
3. Provide friendly error messages
4. Enhance readability with formatting and emojis
5. Add fallback behaviour (loop until Exit chosen)
These steps ensure the user interface meets rubric requirements and improves overall usability.

Me: Perfect. Iâ€™ll implement the menu with pyinputplus first, then add a backup version with input().
