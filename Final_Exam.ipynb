        "The first draft delivered a minimal, working path—load, ask, score—but it lacked defensive checks and user feedback. Iteration 1 deliberately added **input sanitisation**, **safe conversion** with minimal `try/except`, **bounds checks**, and **early exits** on empty data. These choices align with Week 6 (basic input validation and file/console hygiene) and Week 8 (introductory exception handling) while preserving the simplicity expected in an entry‑level unit. Practically, the loop flow became clearer (Week 3) because invalid branches now short‑circuit with `continue`, reducing nested conditions and crash risk.\n",

        "Iteration 2 focused on usability and maintainability. By extracting `print_tasks()` and `show_status()`, we applied Week 2 function decomposition to remove duplication and clarify intent. Adding a `y/n` confirmation before removal addressed a common user error without expanding the feature set beyond the course scope. We intentionally left persistence as a **commented placeholder** (Week 6 alignment) to avoid scope creep.\n",

        "This section applied the course constraint deliberately: only lists, loops, simple functions, and minimal validation. I started by planning the control flow as a menu‑driven loop, then decomposed the behaviour into two helpers—display_menu and get_user_choice—so the main loop remained readable. The guiding idea was to keep state in memory and avoid persistence beyond a placeholder reference from earlier sections. Throughout the implementation I prioritised clarity over compactness.\n",

        "The work is aligned with specific weeks. Week 2 inspired basic data structures and function decomposition. Week 3 informed the loop pattern and branch logic with small early exits. Week 6 guided input hygiene: trimming whitespace, rejecting empty tasks, and giving calm messages instead of cryptic errors. I kept exception handling minimal and instead used simple predicates such as isdigit for safety, which suits the unit’s level.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key gains are predictability and consistency. The interface echoes the same menu, and the output always confirms state with a total count. For future improvement, I would isolate formatting in a tiny printer module and add a compact test harness that feeds canned inputs, while still staying within the introductory boundaries.\n",
